# Beginner-Projects
A collection of beginner-friendly Python projects to practice programming fundamentals.

# Project 1: Hello World + User Input Form

This is the very first beginner project in Python.
It covers two fundamentals:

1. Printing output
2. Taking user input

## Code
```python
print("Hello, World! 👋")

name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Nice to meet you,", name + "! You are", age, "years old.")

Sample Output
Hello, World! 
What is your name? Tanzeel
How old are you? 20
Nice to meet you, Tanzeel! You are 20 years old.

# 🧮 Project 2: Simple Python Calculator  

Welcome to **Project 2** of my **Python Beginner Projects Series**! 🚀  
In this project, we build a **Simple Calculator** that performs the four most common arithmetic operations.  

It’s short, sweet, and perfect for anyone starting their coding journey. 💡

## ✨ Features  

✔️ Addition ➕  
✔️ Subtraction ➖  
✔️ Multiplication ✖️  
✔️ Division ➗ (with **ZeroDivisionError Handling**)  
✔️ Beginner-friendly, clean, and interactive  

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered  

🔹 Taking input from users (`input()`)  
🔹 Type conversion (`float()`)  
🔹 Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)  
🔹 Error handling (division by zero)  
🔹 Displaying formatted output  

---

## 💻 How It Works  

1. The program greets the user with a friendly welcome message.  
2. It asks for **two numbers**.  
3. The user selects an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
4. The calculator instantly displays the **result**.  
5. If division by zero is attempted, it shows an **error message** instead of crashing.

## 📸 Example Runs  

### Example 1
Welcome to Python Calculator! 🧮
Enter first number: 25
Enter second number: 5
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): /

Result: 5.0
